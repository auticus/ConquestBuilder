Added IsFearless - does nothing for output score but will affect unit vs unit comparisons (so for unit vs unit needs added functionality)
Added ResistDecay (need that functionality)
Added [DoubleCast] tag - means they will cast twice
Added DoubleAttack tag - means it can tap twice volley or clash (so calculate unit doing either and take the highest)
Added SelfOnly (so only character)
Added Cleave2, Cleave1, Parry, BrutalImpact2, IsFlurry to characters - some give them that rule (so adjust their property) others add Parry (not sure if thats a rule that needs to be there in the calcs)
---> for spells that have Cleave#, if it has hits then that is applied to the hits, it does not grant them this
Added IsBlessed tag that needs functionality added
Added Reroll#_Volley - reroll the value that comes up on the Volley action - needs added functionality
Added MeleeHeal# - for every impact or clash wound on a 4+ they heal one wound needs added functionality
Added NoObscure tag to regiment - when calculating its volley output do not worry about the obscure score
Added Eruption tag for the eruption spell since it does 2 hits per stand within range not success

* when looking at the tag, things like C|E are Clash +1, Evasion +1, or C|C would be clash +1 twice.  Things like DE would be defense OR evasion
