#TODOs from the R scripts
#TODO - there needs to be a degeneration score on offense (brutes it takes 4 wounds to lose attacks for example)
#perhaps score is full, score at 6 wounds etc
#TODO - there needs to be a way to account for a buffing character with the unit (which adds its own attacks to the mix but don't count its wounds)
#some characters can only heal their regiment - they can have their own entry with the unit
#some characters heal anything.  add a column that shows how much to add to the output score per healing wound (def score / models to get per model then / w to get per wound)
#other characters have attacks - add char columns that have char output (combine clash with range) and add col that is character contribution, then output includes that


Added IsFearless - does nothing for output score but will affect unit vs unit comparisons (so for unit vs unit needs added functionality)
Added ResistDecay (need that functionality)
Added [DoubleCast] tag - means they will cast twice
Added SelfOnly (so only character)
Added Parry, BrutalImpact2, IsFlurry to characters - some give them that rule (so adjust their property) others add Parry (not sure if thats a rule that needs to be there in the calcs)
---> for spells that have Cleave#, if it has hits then that is applied to the hits, it does not grant them this
Added Reroll#_Volley - reroll the value that comes up on the Volley action - needs added functionality
Added MeleeHeal# - for every impact or clash wound on a 4+ they heal one wound needs added functionality
Added Eruption tag for the eruption spell since it does 2 hits per stand within range not success

* when looking at the tag, things like C|E are Clash +1, Evasion +1, or C|C would be clash +1 twice.  Things like DE would be defense OR evasion
